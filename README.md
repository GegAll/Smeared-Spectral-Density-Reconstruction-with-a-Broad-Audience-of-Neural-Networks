# Smeared-Spectral-Density-Reconstruction-with-a-Broad-Audience-of-Neural-Networks
A project to extract smeared spectral densities ($\hat{\rho}(E, \sigma)$) from noisy lattice correlators ($C(t)$) using a "Broad Audience" of neural networks. This method, based on Buzzicotti et al., provides robust predictions with a full systematic error budget. Built to run on Slurm-based HPCs.
